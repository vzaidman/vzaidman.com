      "The virtual DOM is what we generate through the renders of React components.",
      "But React is designed in a way where we don’t care about what happens as a result of these renders.",
      "This lecture aims to explain the relationships between different React elements-",
      "a concept that would help us to reveal React patterns where performance might be an issue.",
      "We would later show how to avoid running into these performance issues."

      "I've recently worked a lot on performance improvement. I've read a lot of articles, and written a lot of lines of code.",
      "I've even maintained one of the most important libraries to detect performance issues (why-did-you-update),",
      "and later wrote an even better library from scratch (why-did-you-render).<br/>",
      "My lecture will focus on how React's Virtual DOM actually works, and how to work with it efficiently when performance issues arise.",
      "We will also talk about what \"performance issues\" actually mean, and how to detect them.<br/>",
