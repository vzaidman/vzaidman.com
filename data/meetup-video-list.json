      "I've recently worked a lot on performance improvement. I've read a lot of articles, and written a lot of lines of code.",
      "I've even maintained one of the most important libraries to detect performance issues (why-did-you-update),",
      "and later wrote an even better library from scratch (why-did-you-render).<br/>",
      "My lecture will focus on how React's Virtual DOM actually works, and how to work with it efficiently when performance issues arise.",
      "We will also talk about what \"performance issues\" actually mean, and how to detect them.<br/>",
